    Constructs and signs a Bitcoin transaction (currently MOCKED).

    This function simulates the creation of a Bitcoin transaction. In a real
    implementation, it would involve:
    1.  Converting BTC amounts to satoshis.
    2.  Selecting appropriate UTXOs to cover the amount plus fee.
    3.  Creating CMutableTxIn objects from these UTXOs.
    4.  Creating CMutableTxOut objects for the recipient and change (if any).
    5.  Building the CMutableTransaction.
    6.  Signing the inputs using the private key.
    7.  Serializing the signed transaction to hexadecimal format.

    Args:
        sender_address (str): The Bitcoin address of the sender (for context).
        private_key_wif (str): The WIF (Wallet Import Format) of the sender's private key.
        recipient_address (str): The Bitcoin address of the recipient.
        amount_btc (Union[float, Decimal]): The amount of BTC to send.
        utxos (List[Dict[str, Any]]): A list of UTXOs available to the sender.
                                      Each UTXO is a dict (e.g., {'txid': '...', 'vout': 0, 'amount_satoshi': ...}).
        fee_btc (Union[float, Decimal]): The transaction fee in BTC.
